Overview

### What is computer vision?

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to interpret and analyze visual data and derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs. Some of its typical real-world applications include: object detection, visual content (images, documents, videos) processing, understanding and analysis, product search, image classification and search, and content moderation.

### Advanced multimodal gen AI

Google Cloud's Vertex AI offers access to [Gemini](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal), a family of cutting-edge, multimodal model that is capable of understanding virtually any input, combining different types of information, and generating almost any output. While Gemini is best suited for tasks that mix visuals, text, and code, [Gemini Pro Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/multimodal/overview#visual_understanding) excels at a wide variety of vision related tasks, such as object recognition, digital content understanding, and captioning/description. It can be accessed through an API.

### Vision focused gen AI

[Imagen on Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/image/overview) brings Google's state-of-the-art image generative AI capabilities to application developers via an API. Some of its [key features](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/image/overview#feature-launch-stage) include [image generation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/image/generate-images) (restricted GA) with text prompts, [image editing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/image/edit-images) (restricted GA) with text prompts, [describing an image in text](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/image/image-captioning) (also known as visual captioning, GA), and subject model fine-tuning (restricted GA). Learn more about its key features and [launch stages](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/image/overview#feature-launch-stage).

### Ready-to-use Vision AI

Powered by Google’s pretrained computer vision ML models, [Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs) is a readily available API (REST and RPC) that allows developers to easily integrate common vision detection [features](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/features-list) within applications, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and tagging of explicit content.

Each feature you apply to an image is a billable unit—Cloud Vision API lets you use 1,000 units of its features for free every month. See [pricing details](https://cloud.google.com/vision/pricing).

### Document understanding gen AI

[Document AI](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai) is a document understanding platform that combines computer vision and other technologies such as natural language processing to extract text and data from scanned documents, transforming unstructured data into structured information and business insights.

It offers [a wide range of pretrained processors](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/processors-list#processor_cde) optimized for different types of documents. It also makes it easy to build custom processors to classify, split, and extract structured data from documents via [Document AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai-workbench).

[![Image 5: speaker next to video title: Document AI - the future of documents](https://www.gstatic.com/bricks/image/7J5Ts_CtMytzsKb0EkIXsVBteL1mKyzY7b3Ikoz_1SATNzWspReAsJRKMRrlnYKqle6VI_VEcIs.png) 4:37 Intro to Document AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_jyoe1lQhg&t=138s)

### Ready-to-use Vision AI for videos

With computer vision technology at its core, [Video Intelligence API](https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence) is an easy way to process, analyze, and understand video content.

Its pretrained ML models automatically recognize a vast number of objects, places, and actions in stored and streaming video, with exceptional quality. It’s highly efficient for [common use cases](https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence#use-cases) such as content moderation and recommendation, media archives, and contextual advertisements. You can also train custom ML models with Vertex AI Vision for your specific needs.

[![Image 6: video title "use ML to make a video archive" on top of a collage of family photos](https://www.gstatic.com/bricks/image/mX9SQmNwH63T-pvQZhWdg-vbsi0HJyciW4Glb2hLao1pbDxM7Ri3IxGnvensAa_REgG5toVZkARt.png) 6:21 Demo: How to use Video Intelligence API to create a searchable video archive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IeS1m8r6SY)

### Visual Inspection AI

[Visual Inspection AI](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/visual-inspection-ai) automates visual inspection tasks in manufacturing and other industrial settings. It leverages advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques to analyze images and videos, identify anomalies, detect and locate defects, and check missing and defect parts in assembled products.

You can train custom models with no technical expertise and minimum labeled images, efficiently run inference at production lines, and continuously refresh models with fresh data from the factory floor.

[![Image 7: assembly line in manufacturing](https://www.gstatic.com/bricks/image/DiY2_ZbnfbjVrPk2Bt46FMPaZxVZA-ZFWkjJxOYAWsL7gPYBGfDJTs65Ncrs_L5-o4ECkPfBtPIX.png) 5:15 Demo - How does Visual Inspection AI work?](https://youtu.be/60Sk-mq3Cr8)

### Unified Vision AI Platform

[Vertex AI Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision-ai/docs) is a fully managed application development environment that lets developers easily build, deploy, and manage computer vision applications to process [a variety of data modalities](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training-overview#types_of_models_you_can_build_using), such as text, image, video, and tabular data. It reduces time to build from days to minutes at one tenth the cost of current offerings.

You can build and deploy your own custom models, and manage and scale them with CI/CD pipelines. It also integrates with popular open source tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

#### How-tos

Unlock insights from nuanced documents with Document AI


-----------------------------------------------------------

Powered by a foundational model, [Document AI Custom Extractor](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/processors-list#processor_cde) extracts text and data from generic and domain-specific documents faster and with higher accuracy. Easily fine-tune with just 5-10 documents for even better performance.

If you want to train your own model, [auto-label](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/workbench/build-custom-processor#use_generative_ai_to_auto-label_documents) your datasets with the foundational model for faster time to production.

You can also choose to use pretrained specialized processors—see the [full list of processors](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/processors-list).

### High-precision visual inspection

#### ![Image 26: build](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/short-term/release/googlesymbols/build/wght100fill1/20px.svg)How-tos

Automate quality inspection with Visual Inspection AI


---------------------------------------------------------

[Visual Inspection AI](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/visual-inspection-ai) is optimized in every step so it’s easy to set up and fast to see ROI. With up to 300 times fewer labeled images to start training high-performance inspection models than general purpose ML platforms, it has shown to deliver up to 10 times higher accuracy. You can train models with no technical expertise, and they run on-premises. Best of all, the models can be continuously refreshed with data flowing from the factory floor, giving you increased accuracy as you discover new use cases.
